# Cloak Of Darkness

["Cloak Of Darkness"](https://docs.textadventures.co.uk/quest/cloak_of_darkness.html) is an extremely simple parser based adventure game. Parser based games adventure games are a sub-genre of interactive fiction ( IF ) where the player interacts with the game through ( extremely simplified ) natural language. "Cloak of Darkness" is sometimes used as the "hello world" of parser IF - it is small enough to port to any new system while being not entirely trivial to implement. The repo here provides the code from which an Alexa skill can be built that allows one to play "Cloak Of Darkness" entirely through voice. 

To actually run this, you need an Amazon Developer account. With this you can then create skills using either ( or both ) the CLI or web-based interfaces. This skill was built as an Alex hosted skill, and it should be simple enough to create a new Alexa-hosted blank skill and replace/add the code and interaction models from here.
